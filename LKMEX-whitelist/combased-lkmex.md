## Purpose
We send to our holders monthly rewards with LKMEX, UTK, RIDE and EGLD.

To farm LKMEX on the dex we use our CDO wallet, which takes 50% of all royalties and earnings from our services. We provide web3 development services and sell our Shopify apps.

To qualify all eligible addresses we use our first open source script, which was actually instrumental in developing Elrond ecosystem.

## Smart Contract Code
https://github.com/xdevguild/sc-multi-sender-rs
This is advised by the xdevguild and perfectly suits our needs. We are against staking, since it requires to send NFTs to particular address, which is less secure then simply registering them with our script.


## Description for every Smart Contract functionality
The Multi Send Esdt function only accepts ESDT as payment. It receives the following arguments:

The token identifier of the ESDT you want to send
One address you want to send to
The amount you want to send to the address
You can add as many addresses and amounts as you want in the arguments but it must remain in order : Address A, Amount A.

## Number of users
On the last distribution we sent LKMEX to 300+ wallets (holders)

## Average LKMEX used during the previous month
On the last distribution we sent around 18,200,000 LKMEX
