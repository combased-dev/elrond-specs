N/A
Still in the development. We might use some available fork, because we were the first project open sourcing our LKMEX distribution script. We would like to keep the logic. Our script is here: https://github.com/Combased/elrond-lkmex-distribution
At the moment we need to get WL and then use the available resources to finish our SC.
